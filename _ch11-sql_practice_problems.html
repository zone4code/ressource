				<h1>Practice problem: Movie search</h1>

				<ul>
					<li>Write a PHP script that connects to the <code>imdb</code> database on <code>webster</code> and searches for all movies whose names match a given prefix, displaying them as an HTML table.  Assume that the prefix is a query string parameter passed into the script.</li>
					<li class="incremental">Consider modifying the code so that, if only one movie matches, it will print the IDs of all actors who acted in that movie.  (This isn't very useful, but we'll improve it next time.)</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="slide">
				<h1>Practice problem: Cast list for a movie</h1>

				<p>
					Write a PHP script that, when given a movie, shows the names of all female actors that appeared in it.  (To do this, you will need to perform an SQL query with join operations.)
