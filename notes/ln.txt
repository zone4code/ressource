notes for Helene
---

good
	calm, not nervous
	friendly, good demeanor
	spoke loudly / clearly / appropriate pace

	didn't go through any material too fast (except few small places)
	technical correctness, didn't seem like a rookie

	very good demonstration of error with "int i", error console to see/fix it

	good tie-in to previous material (link tag, mime type, etc.)

	practice problems were staged, not everything at once
	
	practice problem with my pics was funny (they had not seen those yet!)


improve
	didn't introduce self
		who are you?
		why are you teaching today?

	consider "fessing up" about lack of JS experience (builds trust)

	read some slides to class (partly because I wrote those)
	went a bit too slow in some parts (if, loops, etc.)
	went a bit too fast in others (events/onclick slide)

	when walking through code, tendency to ask too "small" of questions:
		"how do we randomly choose between two things?"
		rather than
		"what kind of statement should we use?"

		didn't finish date example partly because of this

	slide 13, strings: mentioned that length is a property,
		but didn't explain the consequences / meaning of this

	slide 19, Math class: assumed familiarity with Math.random
		when these students are likely more familiar with Random.nextInt()
		(e.g. confusing 0--1 range, scale up, etc.)
			
	slide 25: popup boxes, would be good to do one in the error console 
		to show how it works

	slide 26, Date: didn't mention 0-based month
		(would have been confusing if you'd gotten to Date stuff on
		2nd practice problem)

	probably should have just started 2nd practice problem in link 
		mode rather than inline script (not a big deal)
